# Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/geofoto/Data_Science_portfolio/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

 ## [Machine Learning](https://github.com/geofoto/Machine_Learning)

This repository contains some of the most typical tasks in Machine Learning, **Classification** and **Regression**, along with **Exploratory Data Analysis**, **Algorithm comparison** and **Computer vision**, using some of the most popular datasets like "Bike Sharing", "Breast cancer", "Diabetes" and "MNIST" dataset.

### [Regression and Classification](https://github.com/geofoto/Machine_Learning/tree/main/Regression%20and%20Classification) 

Training different models using **Decision Trees**, **Linear regression** and **Logistic regression** and plot the loss (ùë¶‚àíùë¶ÃÇ) with respect to the training epochs, for each one of the regression models. For all these tasks the "Bike Sharing" dataset has been used.

### [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/geofoto/Machine_Learning/tree/main/Exploratory%20data%20analysis)

 In this task, we apply Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) as an approach of analyzing the datasets, by investigating the dimensions of the data, the data types and their statistical properties. Moreover, after choosing a set of classification and regression algorithms to compare in terms oh their accuracy, we train and evaluate the selected models. For both these tasks the "Breast cancer" and "Diabetes" dataset have been used.

### [Computer vision](https://github.com/geofoto/Machine_Learning/tree/main/Computer%20vision)

A typical **Computer Vision** problem using the "MNIST" dataset. The aim of this task is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of handwritten images. Again, we apply EDA together with algorithm comparison and selection to train and evaluate the best model, which in this case, is proved to be the **k-NN**.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/geofoto/Data_Science_portfolio/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
