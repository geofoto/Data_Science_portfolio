## [Machine Learning](https://github.com/geofoto/Machine_Learning)

This repository contains some of the most typical tasks in Machine Learning, **Classification** and **Regression**, along with **Exploratory Data Analysis**, **Algorithm comparison** and **Computer vision**, using some of the most popular datasets like "Bike Sharing", "Breast cancer", "Diabetes" and the "MNIST" dataset.

### [Regression and Classification](https://github.com/geofoto/Machine_Learning/tree/main/Regression%20and%20Classification) 

Training different models using **Decision Trees**, **Linear regression** and **Logistic regression** and plot the loss (ùë¶‚àíùë¶ÃÇ) with respect to the training epochs, for each one of the regression models. For all these tasks the "Bike Sharing" dataset has been used.

### [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/geofoto/Machine_Learning/tree/main/Exploratory%20data%20analysis)

In this task, we apply Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) as an approach of analyzing the datasets, by investigating the dimensions of the data, the data types and their statistical properties. Moreover, after choosing a set of classification and regression algorithms to compare in terms of their accuracy, we train and evaluate the selected models. For both these tasks the "Breast cancer" and "Diabetes" dataset have been used.

### [Computer vision](https://github.com/geofoto/Machine_Learning/tree/main/Computer%20vision)

A typical **Computer Vision** problem using the "MNIST" dataset. The aim of this task is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of handwritten images. Again, we apply EDA together with algorithm comparison and selection to train and evaluate the best model, which in this case, is proved to be the **k-NN**.

## [Data Visualization](https://github.com/geofoto/Data_visualization)

This repository contains samples for my Data Visualization projects and reports using real-world data, created with 
**Power BI**, **Tableau** and **Kibana**.

### Power BI 

In this project, we created dashboards related to Covid-19 pandemic that provide up-to-date data about coronavirus
infections and deaths worldwide, using the Data Visualization tool **Power BI**. Data can be filtered by country,
or even by cases and deaths and also the top 10 countries are presented.

### Tableau

Next, information around the TSA Claims Data, compiled by the Department of Homeland Security of the United States
are visualized. The datasets contain data about the years 2002-2014 and the dashboards we created, categorize claims
by year, claims by airport, claims status by year, items by claim amount, and items by airport. To perform this project
we used the Data Visualization tool **Tableau**.

### Kibana

In this project, we created dashboards around the causes of flight delays and cancellations in flight problems due to severe weather conditions, using the Data Visualization tool **Kibana**.
